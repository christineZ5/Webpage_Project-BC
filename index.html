<h1>CHIMPANZEES

</h1>
<p>Chimpanzees are great apes found across central and West Africa. Along with bonobos, 
  hey are our closest living relatives, sharing 98.7 percent of our genetic blueprint. 
  Humans and chimps are also thought to share a common ancestor who lived some seven to
   13 million years ago.
</p>
<p><strong>Habitat and diet.</strong>
  Chimpanzees have the widest range of any great ape. Though many populations live in
  tropical rainforests, they can also be found in woodlands and grasslands spanning from 
  central to western Africa. They usually sleep in trees—typically the sturdy Ugandan 
  ironwood tree, which offers the most firm and stable place to sleep—and build themselves
  nests of leaves.Chimps also do most of their eating in trees. Though they generally 
  prefer fruits and plants, they have a varied diet that also includes insects, eggs, nuts, 
  and hundreds of other things. They relish meat, and have been known to kill and eat monkeys,
   small antelope, and even tortoises, which they slam against trees to break open their shells.

</p>

  <strong>Behavior</strong>
  Chimpanzees are highly social. They live in communities of several dozen animals, led by 
  an alpha male and his coalition of male allies. Research has shown that male and female 
  chimps have individual personalities, with females being more trusting and timid. Grooming 
  is an important part of their social life, helping chimpanzees bond as they remove ticks and 
  dirt from one another’s bodies.
  
  Although they normally walk on all fours (knuckle-walking), chimpanzees can stand and 
  walk upright. Chimpanzees have long arms, hands, and fingers, which help them climb 
  trees and swing from branch to branch.Despite our shared lineage, humans are pushing 
  chimpanzees toward extinction. 
</p>
<p>  <strong>Conservation</strong>
  Chimpanzees are protected by national and international laws, including the U.S. Endangered
   Species Act. Some of their habitat is protected as sanctuaries or reserves, too. Conservation
   organizations are working to expand these protected areas, while also pushing for an end to
   the illegal killing and taking of the animals.
  
  Key to securing the future of the chimpanzee, though, is improving its relationship with humans.
  Many organizations work with communities to build awareness about the threats chimpanzees face, 
  develop action plans to preserve their habitats, and help community members develop alternative 
  livelihoods that do not jeopardize the animal’s habitat.  </p>

  <strong>Chimps have already disappeared completely from four countries and are under tremendous 
  pressure everywhere else they live.</strong>
